=========

REP for defining Cartesian paths. This is intended to be an interface for a Cartesian path planner,
rather than a path execution.

Feature list
------------
 * Contains industrial primitives such as linear, circular, etc.)
 * Uses a segment representation

Features required from hardware / driver
----------------------------------------
 * Control interface
 * Cartesian motion primitives
