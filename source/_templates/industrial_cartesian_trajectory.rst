Robot vendor
============
* Textual description
* Name of vendor's programming environment
* Vendor specific programming language
* Version of the user manual
* Source (link)
* etc ...

Trajectory composition
----------------------
List of different motion primitives that users can use to compose/program
Cartesian trajectories (referring to the manual).
Explain parameters if necessary.

* Linear
* Circular
* Point 2 Point
* ...

Waypoint representation
-----------------------
How are Cartesian points specified? (e.g. x,y,z, roll pitch, yaw vs quaternions)

Trajectory parameterization and execution
-----------------------------------------
Describe if and how the following aspects are handled:

* Specification of velocity
* specification of acceleration
* Blending
* Parallel IO operations
* Online (real-time) trajectory modifications

Features required from hardware
-------------------------------
* Applicable to which robots of the vendor?
* Are there requirements that other vendors' robots might not meet?
